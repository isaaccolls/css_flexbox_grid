    <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Just
      relax and let it flow. That easy. Trees grow however makes them happy.</p>
    <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Of course he's a happy little
      stone, cause we don't have any other kind. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. The shadows are just like
      the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever
      start. There we go. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. These things happen automatically. All you have
      to do is just let them happen. Working it up and down, back and forth.</p>
    <p>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things.
      But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later
      there's gonna be a little tree.</p>
    <p>There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and
      animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Here we're limited by the time we have. And just
      raise cain. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening -
      you just let it happen.</p>
    <p>Every time you practice, you learn more. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. I
      think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Only think about one thing at a time.
      Don't get greedy.</p>
    <p>There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. By now you should be quite
      happy about what's happening here. Put it in, leave it alone. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out
      which way works best for you. You gotta think like a tree.</p>
