      <p>Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Fluff that up. There we are. Volunteering your time; it
        pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. At home you have unlimited time. We might as well make
        some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.</p>
      <p>You need the dark in order to show the light. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make
        in school. Happy painting, God bless. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? You can do anything your
        heart can imagine. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something
        beautiful out of it.</p>
      <p>We need dark in order to show light. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Here's
        something that's fun. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>
      <p>This is unplanned it really just happens. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Clouds are free they come and go
        as they please. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Let all these things just sort of
        happen.</p>
      <p>Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. We'll take a little
        bit of Van Dyke Brown.</p>
      <p>We need a shadow side and a highlight side. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. This is your
        creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The
        sun wouldn't forget them.</p>
      <p>Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Almost everything is going to happen for you
        automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. This piece of canvas is your world.</p>
